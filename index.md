## Course Overview
<p align="justify">University of Eastern Finland (UEF) hosts a number of different summer
courses in August 2019. The course <span style="color:blue"> Deep Reinforcement Learning for Computer Games </span> is organized by the School
of Computing of the UEF. The teaching takes place at the Joensuu campus of the UEF from August 12th to 16th.</p>

<!--The first day includes course introduction, introduction to machine
learning, linear mixed models and basics of deep learning for modeling
sequential data. The next two days focus on audio topics (speaker &
speech recognition, speaker diarization, speech enhancement, audio
steganography), while the last two lecture days focus on reinforcement
learning and autonomous software and physical agents (robots).-->

<p align="justify">The course is intended as a brief introduction to reinforcement learning and its application to different game applications. It provides an introduction to reinforcement learning, starting from the basics and ending up with advanced topics like deep reinforcement learning for video games and robotics. The course will cover lectures, practicals, project and learning diary. While no formal pre-requirements are set, programming knowledge of Python, certain level of mathematics/statistics and deep neural network will be helpful for the maximum benefit of the participant.</p>
