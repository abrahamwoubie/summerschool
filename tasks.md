## Preparing for practicals
If you are bringing your own laptop, follow instructions on the following page before first practical session:  ([http://cs.uef.fi/~anssk/summer19/installation.html]( http://cs.uef.fi/~anssk/summer19/installation.html))

## Learning diary

<!--Filled learning diary can be returned in Moodle ([https://moodle.uef.fi/course/view.php?id=17032](https://moodle.uef.fi/course/view.php?id=17032)). <!--([https://moodle.uef.fi/course/view.php?id=17032](https://moodle.uef.fi/course/view.php?id=17032))-->

To obtain 3 ECTS from the course, participants are required to submit a filled learning diary that contains answers to different questions related to the course lectures.
 
The deadline for the submission of the learning diary is 30.8.2019, and answers should be returned to anssk@uef.fi with title beginning [Summer School]. 

The learning diary can be accessed in the following link ([https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yHpOYxqJTjXMKuBpcK-tb_nu2kYC45Z1](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yHpOYxqJTjXMKuBpcK-tb_nu2kYC45Z1))

## Project work (done after the course)

By returning an individual project work of sufficient quality, you can get additional 2 ECTS (in total 5 ECTS).

For the project work details, look ([http://cs.uef.fi/~anssk/summer19/project_topics.html](http://cs.uef.fi/~anssk/summer19/project_topics.html))

<!--
#### Challenge 1: Train an agent that plays Toribash
- Toribash is a 1v1 fighting game.
- Design and/or train an agent for Toribash-DestroyUke-v1 task: The higher cumulative reward at the end of the game/episode, the better. Find the environment from Github link below.
- Ready made learning environment (ToriLLE) can be found from this link:
[https://github.com/Miffyli/ToriLLE](https://github.com/Miffyli/ToriLLE)
- Information about ToriLLE can be found from our paper
[https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10110](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10110)

#### Challenge 2: Imitating a celebrity voice
- Use the corpus VoxCeleb ([http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/))
- It contains a very large number (> 1000) of celebrity voices. Find closest to
your voice using speaker recognition technology.
- Try to see if you can get better score by modifying your voice.
- Get the project package including pre-trained speaker recognition models from [here](http://cs.uef.fi/~vvestman/files/celeb_match_project.zip).

#### Challenge 3: Test the impact of environmental noise in a Speaker Recognition System (SRS)
- Modify a set of speech signals from Voxceleb by adding noise and test the performance of the SRS (Use the SRS from the practice)
- Apply a speech enhancement method and recheck the system performance (e.g. Wiener filter in Scipy)
- Challenge the system with a different issue and compare results (e.g. short duration)
- Record your own voice and repeat the process. Compare the obtained results with the one with the previous set of signals and discuss.
- Get the project package including pre-trained speaker recognition models from [here](http://cs.uef.fi/~vvestman/files/challenge3.zip). -->
